Some long-duration gamma-ray bursts are driven by magnetars
Observations from the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) La Silla and Paranal Observatories in Chile have for the first time demonstrated a link between a long-lasting burst of gamma rays and an unusually bright supernova explosion. The resu...
                        




New Horizons map of Pluto: The whale and the doughnut

Cosmology looks beyond the standard model
What are the mysterious dark matter and dark energy that seem to account for so much of our universe? Why is the universe expanding? For the past 30 years, most cosmologists have looked to the “standard model” to answer these questions an...
                        




Rings and loops in the stars: Planckâ€™s stunning new images

Pluto: The "other" red planet
What color is Pluto? The answer, revealed in the first maps made from New Horizons data, turns out to be shades of reddish brown. Although this is reminiscent of Mars, the cause is almost certainly very different. On Mars, the coloring agent is iron ...

Spots on Pluto fascinate as New Horizons gets the all clear
New color images from NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft show two very different faces of the mysterious dwarf planet, one with a series of intriguing spots along the equator that are evenly spaced. Each of the spots is about 300 miles (480 kilomet...
                        




Rosetta spacecraft sees sinkholes on comet
The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Rosetta spacecraft first began orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014. Almost immediately, scientists began to wonder about several surprisingly deep, almost perfectly circular pits on the come...

Can planets be rejuvenated around dead stars?
For a planet, this would be like a day at the spa. After years of growing old, a massive planet could, in theory, brighten up with a radiant youthful glow. Rejuvenated planets, as they are nicknamed, are only hypothetical. But new research from NASA&...

New supercomputer model shows planet-making waves in nearby debris disk
A new NASA supercomputer simulation of the planet and debris disk around the nearby star Beta Pictoris reveals that the planet’s motion drives spiral waves throughout the disk, a phenomenon that causes collisions among the orbiting debris. Patt...
