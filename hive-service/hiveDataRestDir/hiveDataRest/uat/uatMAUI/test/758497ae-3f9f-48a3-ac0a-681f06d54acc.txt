(At least in the U.S. and four other countries. In France and the UK, Siri is male.)People describe the app using female pronouns. Her gender has even prompted some users to flood blogs and online forums with sexually suggestive questions for Siri such as "What are you wearing?" (Siri's baffled response: "Why do people keep asking me this?")The fuss over Siri's sex also raises a larger question: From voice-mail systems to GPS devices to Siri and beyond, why are so many computerized voices female?One answer may lie in biology. Scientific studies have shown that people generally find women's voices more pleasing than men's."It's much easier to find a female voice that everyone likes than a male voice that everyone likes," said Stanford University Professor Clifford Nass, author of "The Man Who Lied to His Laptop: What Machines Teach Us About Human Relationships." "It's a well-established phenomenon that the human brain is developed to like female voices."HAL, the homicidal artificial intelligence in "2001: A space Odyssey," may have scared manufacturers away from male automated voices.Research suggests this preference starts as early as the womb, Nass said. He cites a study in which fetuses were found to react to the sound of their mother's voice but not to other female voices. The fetuses showed no distinct reaction to their father's voice, however.Another answer lies in history. According to some sources, the use of female voices in navigation devices dates back to World War II, when women's voices were employed in airplane cockpits because they stood out among the male pilots. And telephone operators have traditionally been female, making people accustomed to getting assistance from a disembodied woman's voice.When automakers were first installing automated voice prompts in cars ("your door is ajar") decades ago, their consumer research found that people overwhelmingly preferred female voices to male ones, said Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley analyst and president of Creative Strategies Inc.This may explain why in almost all GPS navigation systems on the market, the default voice is female. One notable exception has been Germany, where BMW was forced to recall a female-voiced navigation system on its 5 Series cars in the late 1990s after being flooded with calls from German men saying they refused to take directions from a woman."Cultural stereotypes run deep," said Nass, who details the BMW episode in his book.Voice castingMost companies that produce automated voices hold auditions for voice actors and collect recordings of them speaking. Then they invite focus groups to listen to the recordings and rate the voices on how well they convey certain attributes: warmth, friendliness, competence and so on."It's casting," Nass said. "It's something Hollywood has known for a long, long time."Look no further than examples of automated or artificial-intelligence voices in sci-fi movies and TV shows. Voices of authority or menace tend to be male: the homicidal HAL 9000 computer in "2001: A Space Odyssey," the computer program in "WarGames," or Auto, the spaceship's autopilot function in "Wall-E." More subservient talking machines, such as the onboard computer from the "Star Trek" TV series, skew female.Bajarin, the Silicon Valley analyst, believes that more computerized voices would be masculine if not for the associations with HAL, whose malicious intent in the 1968 Stanley Kubrick film was made even creepier by his soothing tone."A lot of tech companies stayed away from the male voice because of HAL," he said. "I've heard that theory tossed around multiple times." (One prominent exception: The chipper "You've got mail!" voice from AOL's dial-up days.)What Apple did is absolutely brilliant. They took Siri and gave it more of a personality.Norman WinarskyWhen it comes to consumer applications of computerized voices, the sex of the voice is usually determined by what service or product is employing it. For example, transit systems such as the San Francisco Area's BART often use higher-pitched voices because they are easier to hear over the clatter of the train cars.Nuance, a Massachusetts-based company that develops speech technologies for Ford vehicles' SYNC system, Amazon e-readers and other clients, creates both male and female voices. It's then up to the client to choose which voice, and gender, best fits their product, said chief creative officer Gary Clayton."As these products become part of our everyday lives, there's a huge opportunity for personalization," added Brant Ward, the company's director of advanced speech design. "I could have an approximation of my wife's voice read me a text message in my car."Siri: Brilliant or sexist?Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice, grew from a five-year research project that was funded by military agency DARPA and led by SRI International, a Bay Area research institute. The project spawned a company, also called Siri, that launched an iPhone app in February 2010 and was acquired by Apple two months later.That original Siri voice-to-text app -- powered in part by Nuance's technology -- also worked by people speaking commands into their phones, although it didn't talk back. And it had no gender. In fact, the app was originally conceived to speak in a gender-neutral voice, said Norman Winarsky, vice president of SRI and a co-founder of Siri."What Apple did is absolutely brilliant," said Winarsky, who calls speech "the most natural of all human interfaces.""They took Siri and gave it more of a personality," he said. "It's the first real artificial intelligence working in millions of people's hands."An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on why the company gave Siri a female voice in the U.S. Nor would she say why Siri speaks like a man in the UK, where iPhone 4S owners have swarmed online forums to request a female voice instead. "Eww!! Hope UK gets female voice soon," wrote one commenter. "I don't think anyone in the US cares about male voice option."Many GPS devices and computer text-to-speech programs now offer multiple voice options. And someday soon, voice-technology experts say, Siri will probably speak in a variety of voices, too.Until then, some bloggers have wondered: Are computerized female "assistants" sexist?Not necessarily, said Rebecca Zorach, director of the Social Media Project at the University of Chicago's Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality."I think they have to be understood in a broader context in which they're one small piece," she wrote in an e-mail to CNN. "Voices intended to convey authority (such as voice-over narration in films) tend to be male. So yes, probably these compliant female robot voices reinforce gender stereotypes, not just because they serve the user but because the technology itself is about communication and relationships (areas that women are presumed to be good at)."I wouldn't automatically claim any sexism in individual companies' choices, though. Most such decisions are probably the result of market research, so they may be reflecting gender stereotypes that already exist in the general public."Zorach listened to some sound clips of Siri online, then e-mailed back again."What's interesting to me is how they seem to intentionally make her speech sound artificial -- they could choose to make her speech more seamless and human-like, but they choose instead to highlight the technology," she said. "That makes you aware of how high-tech your gadget is."Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the web[TECH: NEWSPULSE]Most popular Tech stories right nowApple's Siri will need to learn new tricksWhy computer voices are mostly femaleMC Hammer launching his own search engineWhy Google doesn't care about tabletsTop complaints so far about the iPhone 4SExplore the news with NewsPulse » Loading weather data...

Saddened and disgusted by the footage from a slaughterhouse, the Chicago girl announced she was no longer going to eat meat. Her parents were less than thrilled."When she first said she wanted to be a vegetarian, we were just looking at each other and we said, 'We can't be switching meals for you. You are not going to get your protein.' We were not educated in the health benefits," said Gianni's mother, Julie Gianni.While many parents worry whether their vegetarian or vegan children will receive adequate nutrition for their growing bodies, the American Dietetic Association says such diets, as long as they are well-planned, are appropriate for all phases of life, including childhood and adolescence. "Appropriately planned" vegetarian or vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases, the dietetic association says."You can really feel the difference when you are eating something from the ground and something from a factory," said Niki Gianni, an animal activist who became a vegan shortly after embracing the vegetarian lifestyle.10-year-old: Why I became vegetarian in first gradeNow an 18-year-old college freshman, Niki Gianni said her eating habits expanded her palate and turned her away from processed foods. Her food choices also influenced her family: Her mother is now a vegan and her father and sister are vegetarians.The number of vegetarians in the United States is expected to increase over the next decade, according to the dietetic association. A vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease, and vegetarians also appear to have lower overall cancer rates, lower blood pressure and lower rates of hypertension than nonvegetarians.Vegetarianism is more than just not eating meat, said Roberta Anding, a registered dietitian at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital and a spokesperson for the dietetic association."It's really embracing more of that plant-based lifestyle and having enough variety in your diet that you can be well-nourished," Anding said. "You can be unbelievably well-nourished on a vegetarian diet if you choose your foods wisely and appropriately."Lilian Cheung, director of health promotion and communication at Harvard School of Public Health's Department of Nutrition, agreed. Teens who abstain from eating animal-based foods but who take in refined and sugary foods such as French fries and sodas are not doing themselves any favors, she said.Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits of all colors and eating the purest form possible is vital in these diets, Cheung said. Beans, legumes, nuts, tofu and seeds all are excellent protein sources, said Cheung, who said veganism and vegetarianism are becoming more mainstream among young people."I think the reason why veganism is getting more and more popular is there are more celebrities like President Clinton," embracing the lifestyle, said Cheung, editorial director of the department's nutrition website, The Nutrition Source.Niki, left, and Julie Gianni are vegans and actively participate in animal rights events. Julie and Niki Gianni said they have encountered a lot of people who had misconceptions about vegans and vegetarians, including that they are weak or that they are not getting the vitamins and minerals they need."(People) asked, 'How are you going to get your protein?' They just look at you like you are abusing your children," Julie Gianni said.In the beginning, the Giannis didn't quite know what to serve their daughter. Niki Gianni ate a lot of vegetarian burger patties and chicken nuggets."I think this happens to a lot of vegetarians: I doubled up on eating eggs and dairy because my parents weren't sure what to feed their 12-year-old who didn't eat meat," she said.Now, Julie Gianni makes her own goulash and noodles and frequently cooks with seitan, a high-protein meat substitute made from wheat. Niki Gianni said she has yet to find a vegetable she won't eat. She loves portobello mushroom and artichoke sandwiches, and dines in the vegan cafeteria at college.Niki Gianni and her family have done copious research about their lifestyles, becoming educated about meeting their nutritional needs through an array of fresh foods.Such vigilance and education is vital, experts said, because adolescence is characterized by the second and final period of rapid growth and development. Those growing bodies need nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D, B12 and iron.Teens or children who are vegetarian and who then also decide to give up dairy products need to find an alternate source of calcium, Anding said. While calcium can be found in almonds and in green leafy vegetables, the amount is small.Vitamin B12, found in animal protein, can become a concern if dairy or eggs leave the diet, Anding said. Vitamin B12 deficiencies manifest over time. The vitamin, which can be found in fortified cereals, is stored in the liver and when levels are low, the body withdraws the vitamin from the organ."Sooner or later you are going to run out," Anding said. "It's not going to be instant."Anding said she treated four young women with vitamin B12 deficiencies that showed up about a year into their veganism."You can end up with permanent cognitive issues. I applaud you for looking at this from an environmental perspective but I don't want to save the planet and sacrifice you," she said. "You have to take a B12 supplement."To aid iron intake, Anding recommends using a cast iron skillet for cooking; some of the iron will leach into the food. Vitamin and mineral supplements also provide a way to get adequate iron and other essential nutrients, she said."Clearly, there are some big benefits of a plant-based diet, so I'm not objecting to that. I think the more restrictive the diet becomes, the more exclusive the diet becomes, the harder it becomes for the average person to execute those diet changes," she said.Heather Lazaro, whose family lives in Orange County in Southern California, said she was concerned when her daughter, then 11, came home from school and announced she didn't want to eat meat."We didn't think it was going to last," said Lazaro, whose daughter Alyssa is now 16. "To this day, I always worry if she is getting the right amount of protein and vitamins" and nutrition she needs, she said.Alyssa Lazaro is a pescatarian; she doesn't eat land animals or birds but eats fish. She said she just wanted to try giving up meat. In addition to consuming plenty of vegetables and fruit, she eats soy products, protein shakes and eggs. She said she feels better staying away from meat."Whenever I eat vegetables I just feel a little bit more energetic and ready to go through life with a big smile on my face," the high school student said.Anding and Cheung said young people and their parents should get information from reputable websites such as eatright.org, kidseatright.org and thenutritionsource.org.Vegetarians and vegans have to be willing to explore new foods and Anding said she would discourage such lifestyles for children who like only a handful of foods, including meat.Anding, who for decades has worked with children and teens with eating disorders, said parents also need to make sure their children are eating. She has seen veganism used to mask those disorders."It's really unfortunate because it is taking a lifestyle that is unbelievably healthy and using it to perpetuate an eating disorder," she said.Cheung recommends that parents talk to their children's pediatrician about a vitamin supplement and have them see a registered dietician so they have a good overview of what they should be eating every day."It can be a very unhealthy diet if the choices are unhealthy," she said. "But it is very possible to have a very healthful vegan diet as well if you choose wisely."We just need to get more literate, get more knowledge. I don't think we should basically just categorize one way or another," Cheung said. "It just depends on what foods are chosen."Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webNewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse »   Healthcare Jobs Sales and Marketing Jobs Finance Jobs Quick Job Search   Job type ----------------- Accounting Admin & Clerical Automotive Banking Biotech Broadcast - Journalism Business Development Construction Consultant Customer Service Design Distribution - Shipping Education Engineering Entry Level - New Grad Executive Facilities Finance General Business General Labor Government Grocery Healthcare Hotel - Hospitality Human Resources Information Technology Installation - Maint - Repair Insurance Inventory Legal Legal Admin Management Manufacturing Marketing Nurse Other Pharmacy Professional Services Purchasing - Procurement QA - Quality Control Research Restaurant - Food Service Retail Sales Science Skilled Labor - Trades Strategy - Planning Supply Chain Telecomm Training Transportation Warehouse State ------- AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA PR RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY   more options »         Loading weather data...

"If you get an EMF reading in a graveyard, there is no electricity there, so it has to be coming from some other source."Oftentimes, the spirits you may encounter in a cemetery aren't kind or frightening but rather full of grief in this final resting place."Oddly enough, a lot of cemeteries aren't that haunted," said Richard Senate, a historian and ghost hunter of 33 years. "People haunt where they loved. The idea of haunting a cemetery outside of someone who is grieving -- that's what we're picking up, the grief of a person, rather than their spirit linked to a site."However, there are still an abundance of spirits roaming their final resting place, he said. Senate shared what he regards as some of the most haunted cemeteries in America. Visiting one of these historic sites just may introduce you to someone, or something, waiting on the other side.St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, New OrleansRich with history and lore, New Orleans' above-ground cemeteries have been inspiration for storytellers and authors alike. Before these elaborate tombs were built, the ground often gave up the recently buried during floods or heavy rains. Because the city is situated below the water table, burial was not a practical option, and the small cities of above-ground tombs began.Cemetery No. 1 is perhaps the most famous of New Orleans' cemeteries. Visitors have witnessed phantom figures, Civil War ghosts and yellow fever victims restlessly stalking through the maze of crypts, Senate said. But perhaps the most well-known spirit is that of Marie Laveau, the city's own voodoo queen. She is often seen walking the grounds."She haunts her tomb," Senate said. "If you go there, take along a piece of chalk, make 3 X's on her tomb, and if you ask a prayer or request, she will help you get it. Always bring your chalk."After pausing, Senate added, "It's a pretty creepy place. I don't know if I want to be there at night."Resurrection Catholic Cemetery, ChicagoNot all cemetery hauntings involve walking through a graveyard at night. Chicago's most famous spirit is really just looking for some company, and a way home.The locals call her "Resurrection Mary," Senate said. She is seen not only within the cemetery but just outside of the gates. If you're driving through the area, she just may try to hitch a ride.Over the years, thousands of people have reported a young woman who flags down passing cars for a ride home. When they ask for an address, she supplies that of the cemetery. Often, "Mary" vanishes in the car or steps out at the cemetery and fades into darkness, Senate said.During the '30s, a Polish woman between the ages of 17 and 22 was on her way back from a dance at the O'Henry Ballroom when she was killed in a car accident. She was buried in Resurrection Cemetery, and locals believe that this is "Mary." She is always seen wearing a vintage ball gown and seems incredibly lifelike -- until she vanishes. Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood, CaliforniaNot only is this cemetery full of Hollywood legends from the silent film era to our recently departed celebrities, Senate says it is also full of ghosts. And they don't just come out at night; you can see Hollywood's ghosts during the day.Before Rudolph Valentino died, he made a habit of visiting hospitals and spending time with children. He spoke to one little girl who was going to have an operation and offered her words of encouragement. The girl survived her operation and recovered.When Valentino died, she vowed to visit his grave each year and place a red rose on his gravestone. She became known as "the lady in black," and she was quite visible in the '30s. But when the lady in black died, her ghost carried on the tradition. Both her and Valentino's ghosts have been seen by his grave, Senate said.Of course, these are just a couple of the site's rumored hauntings.Boothill Cemetery, Tombstone, ArizonaOnce a rollicking silver rush town, Tombstone is now the true embodiment of a ghost town. The scenes of incredible violence that took place in its lawless streets still resonate, especially the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral among the Clantons, the Earps and Doc Holliday. Three of the Clanton gang were killed in the fight, which only lasted about 30 seconds. They now rest in Boothill Cemetery, alongside gamblers, smugglers and outlaws, Senate said.There are dozens of "boot hill" cemeteries across the country, especially the West. The name refers to those who "died with their boots on" or in a violent way. But Tombstone's cemetery, and the entire town, is considered to be one of the most haunted. Ghosts of outlaws and the Clanton gang are often seen in the cemetery, hoping to avenge their death."Tombstone is a true place for ghost hunters to go," Senate said. "It is chock full of haunted sites, and the cemetery is but one."Gettsyburg Cemetery, Gettysburg, PennsylvaniaThe site of one of the deadliest battles in American history is naturally still haunted by the vestiges of war, where families clashed and broke apart on the battlefield during a staggering three-day campaign.The battlefield itself became a burial ground for thousands of men, many of whom were later relocated to proper graves. The Gettysburg Cemetery offers a final resting place for all of the men who never made it home. Shadowy phantom figures in both Union and Confederate uniforms still pace the battlefield and cemetery.But Senate notes that one of the most persistent ghosts is really just there to be social. In the cemetery, a man is often seen wearing a black hat with a star, symbolic of one of the Texas regiments fighting with the Confederates at Gettysburg. He often tries to converse with tourists and on several occasions has posed with families for photos or takes a photo of family if they request it, Senate said. During photo development or even on the camera's screen, the man disappears.For an encapsulating haunted experience, Senate recommends staying in the Farnsworth House Inn. Confederate snipers hid in the house during the battle, and their ghosts roam the rooms today.If you goShould you decide to stop by any of these cemeteries and go on your own ghost hunt, Senate has a few words of advice. Remember to be respectful of those who have passed on, and don't disturb any grave to try to incite a ghost."You should be like a ghost: No one should know you've even been there," Senate said.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webNewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse » Loading weather data...

A face of nightmare terror and shivery awe, one that will shoot a scary volt of revelation right through us. We're never entirely sure if that face is going to arrive, but the anticipation is everything. The movie sets us up for it early on, with an amazing shock as a closet door is opened.Of course, we're also waiting because, with two other "Paranormal Activity" films behind it, "Paranormal Activity 3" implicitly understands that we've been through enough tricks in these movies -- the doors that open and slam shut, the thuds and booms and scratchy skitters on the soundtrack, the kitchen utensils that fall with a crash, the spectral shapes that you can almost make out -- to now want to see something more. "Paranormal Activity 3" features variations on every one of the tricks I just mentioned, and a few additional ones (they all work), but more than the first two films, it tweaks our desire to put a face on evil.The movie is a prequel, set in September 1988, though it doesn't exactly look like an '80s period piece. The spacious, high-ceilinged Carlsbad, California, tract home in which it takes place looks a lot like the one in the more contemporary "Paranormal Activity 2," with tastefully bland furniture that might have come out of the Raymour & Flanigan suburban-gothic collection.This time, the family consists of Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith, who's like a skinny young Gary Dell'Abate), a wedding videographer who has banks of monitors and editing equipment in his home studio; his big-haired sexy wife, Julie (Lauren Bittner); and her two preteen daughters from a previous marriage.They are Katie (Chloe Csengery), who will grow up to be the Katie Featherstone character in the first film, and angel-faced Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown), from "Paranormal Activity 2," here an enigmatic child who can communicate with the spirit world. It's one of this haunted-house movie's best jokes that the ghost on hand is Kristi's invisible friend, ''Toby,'' whom she talks to with a mixture of intimacy and intimidated formality.As soon as the family begins to hear mysterious sounds in their new home, Dennis insists on rigging up a handful of video cameras as makeshift surveillance devices. We get time-coded views of the parents' and kids' bedrooms -- and, most cleverly, there's a camera mounted on the base of a rotating fan that pans back and forth, with fearful deliberation, from the kitchen, with its pristine white cabinets, to the living room, with its creepy looped lamp in the foreground.The directors, Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, are the fascinatingly deadpan pranksters who made "Catfish," last year's is-it-a-documentary-or-a-rigged-stunt? investigation into the fake identities that people can forge on the Internet. They turn out to be the perfect filmmakers to create a banal surface reality that's just warped enough to keep us on tenterhooks.The bottom line, for me, is this: I don't scare easily at horror films (that's one of the reasons I tend to pan them), but I watched "Paranormal Activity 3" in a state of high anxiety. Schulman and Joost have fun with the archetypal image of a white-sheeted costume ghost, but mostly what they're aces at is timing. They know just how to thread a handheld camera up the stairs, down a hallway, and into the scattered bric-a-brac of a middle-class children's bedroom, settling at just the right moment upon a talking teddy bear that plays as a joke, even as a part of you momentarily thinks: Is that bear possessed?They also make terrific use of characters like Dennis's assistant, a Napoleon Dynamite type, played with an infectious spark by Dustin Ingram, who ends up huddling in a darkened bathroom with young Katie for a scary game of ''Bloody Mary'' (say it three times and wait to see what happens).There's no denying that the "Paranormal Activity" films adhere, by now, to a formula; this one, almost by definition, lacks the originality that made the first one so startling. But when you consider how the grimy, mangle-fest "Saw" sequels have ruled the Halloween season in recent years, it's refreshing to think that the spook-show franchise that has now caught the popular imagination has replaced depravity and sadism with a 21st-century, video-reality version of old-school campfire shivers. In her review of "The Shining," Pauline Kael asked -- derisively -- ''Who wants to see evil in daylight, through a wide-angle lens?'' The answer, it turns out, is everybody.EW.com rating: A-See the full article at EW.com.CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly© 2010 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"The coming months will be a season of homecomings. Our troops in Iraq will definitely be home for the holidays."Of the 39,000 troops in Iraq, about 150, a negligible force, will remain to assist in arms sales, a U.S. official told CNN. The rest will be out of Iraq by December 31.The president said he was making good on his 2008 campaign pledge to end a war that has divided the nation since it began in 2003 and claimed more than 4,400 American lives. It also came after talks that might have allowed a continued major military presence broke down amid disputes as to whether U.S. troops would be immune to prosecution by Iraqi authorities.Beyond the human cost, the price tag for U.S. military activity in Iraq has been steep as well. The Defense Department estimated that its operations there over the past decade have cost more than $700 billion.Obama spoke with Iraqi President Nuri al-Maliki in a video conference Friday, after which he said both nations were comfortable with the decision on how to move forward.The new partnership with Iraq will be "strong and enduring," Obama said.U.S. soldiers with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment patrol July 17 in Iskandariya, Iraq."The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their head held high, proud of their success, and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops," Obama said.Paul Rieckhoff -- an ex-Army soldier who heads the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the first and largest such organization for these veterans, according to its website -- cheered Friday's announcement as "really good news for the troops serving overseas.""It's a really poignant time, especially for the veterans community," Rieckhoff told CNN. "Many of us gave large parts of our lives, some gave all in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn."A current Status of Force Agreement had called for U.S. forces to leave Iraq by the end of 2011. But lengthy negotiations had given rise to an expectation that American troops -- roughly 40,000 of which are in Iraq -- would remain on Iraqi soil into next year.These talks, however, broke down over the prickly issue of legal immunity for U.S. troops in Iraq, a senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the discussions told CNN this month.Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other top brass have repeatedly said any deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the withdrawal deadline would require a guarantee of legal protection for American soldiers.But the Iraqis refused to agree to that, opening up the prospect of Americans being tried in Iraqi courts and subjected to Iraqi punishment.The negotiations were strained following WikiLeaks' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged Iraqi civilians, including children, were killed in a 2006 raid by American troops rather than in an airstrike as the U.S. military initially reported.U.S. troops have already started the drawdown. For instance, a brigade from Fort Bliss, Texas, that was originally scheduled to be among the last to leave Iraq was being pulled out of the country months ahead of its planned departure, military officials told CNN last week.That said, officials said the drastic pullback of troops does not mean an end to the U.S. government's presence in Iraq.State Department spokesman Mark Toner described Friday's development as the start of "a new chapter in our relationship" with Iraq -- while acknowledging the challenges of the change."You can't flip a switch and go from a military operation to a civilian operation; there has to be a transition and we're working on that transition," he said. "But we believe we're ready."Toner added that the U.S. government has been preparing all along for the year-end deadline, including addressing the "security needs" of nonmilitary U.S. personnel who will remain in Iraq.That includes about 1,700 diplomats, law enforcement officers and various economic, agriculture and other professionals and experts who will be in Iraq into 2012, according to the State Department. In addition, 5,000 security contractors will protect the U.S. diplomats and another 4,500 contractors will serve other roles, such as helping provide food and medical services, until they can be done locally.Toner said the U.S. and Iraqi governments are still talking about security and other matters, though he stressed any such discussions should not change the basic decision announced Friday."We continue to talk about the post-December 31 arrangement (and) security relationship," Toner said. "At the same time, we are very committed to meeting the December 31 deadline."CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webNewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse » Loading weather data...

Carl Levin said Obama made the right decision Sen. Lindsey Graham says he respectfully disagrees with announcement Sen. Barbara Boxer says she applauds "President Obama for a promise kept"(CNN) -- The White House decision to withdraw virtually all U.S. troops from Iraq by year's end would make good on a 2008 presidential campaign pledge by then-candidate Barack Obama, but it's also likely to draw a range of opinions as part of the current election season."As for U.S. domestic politics," said David Mack, Middle East Institute scholar and former U.S. ambassador, "most of the American public is fed up with our involvement in Iraq.""It's fine for (Sen. John McCain) and for (Sen. Lindsey Graham) to make a case for this... but the American public made it very clear," Mack said.Others question the wisdom of Friday's announcement and whether it reflects a precipitous withdrawal that could ultimately harm U.S. interests abroad.McCain, R-Arizona, has said Obama's plans for withdrawal in both Iraq and Afghanistan "is not the 'modest' withdrawal that I and others had hoped for and advocated."Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a GOP presidential hopeful, said Friday that the move comes amid "Obama's astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in Iraq" and that "the American people deserve to hear the recommendations that were made by our military commanders in Iraq."Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, said she applauds "President Obama for a promise kept.""Today is a day to honor our troops and our military families who have sacrificed so much over the last nine years to give the Iraqi people a chance at a better future," said Boxer. "It is now up to the Iraqis to secure their country and provide opportunity for all their people."Following the president's announcement, Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said that he respectfully disagrees with the decision."I feel all we have worked for, fought for, and sacrificed for is very much in jeopardy by today's announcement," he said. "I hope I am wrong and the president is right, but I fear this decision has set in motion events that will come back to haunt our country."Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan said he was "prepared to support a continued presence of U.S. trainers in Iraq beyond the end of this year.""But in light of Iraq's refusal to eliminate the possibility that U.S. troops would face prosecutions in Iraqi courts, President Obama has made the right decision," he added.U.S.-Iraq talks broke down over the issue of legal immunity for U.S. troops, a senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the discussions told CNN this month.Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and other top brass have repeatedly said any deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the withdrawal deadline would require a guarantee of legal protection for American soldiers.But the Iraqi leaders refused to agree to that, opening up the prospect of Americans being tried in Iraqi courts and subjected to Iraqi punishment.Of the 39,000 troops in Iraq, only about 150 will remain to assist in arms sales, a U.S. official told CNN. The rest will be out of Iraq by December 31.The Iraq war, which began in the spring of 2003, has left more than 4,400 Americans dead and killed countless Iraqis.In Afghanistan, the remainder of the so-called "surge" force is scheduled to leave by September 2012, while the full American withdrawal is expected to take place by the end of 2014.U.S. diplomats, however, have openly discussed the possibility of a much longer commitment in that country.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webNewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse »   Healthcare Jobs Sales and Marketing Jobs Finance Jobs Quick Job Search   Job type ----------------- Accounting Admin & Clerical Automotive Banking Biotech Broadcast - Journalism Business Development Construction Consultant Customer Service Design Distribution - Shipping Education Engineering Entry Level - New Grad Executive Facilities Finance General Business General Labor Government Grocery Healthcare Hotel - Hospitality Human Resources Information Technology Installation - Maint - Repair Insurance Inventory Legal Legal Admin Management Manufacturing Marketing Nurse Other Pharmacy Professional Services Purchasing - Procurement QA - Quality Control Research Restaurant - Food Service Retail Sales Science Skilled Labor - Trades Strategy - Planning Supply Chain Telecomm Training Transportation Warehouse State ------- AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA PR RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY   more options »         Loading weather data...

The NTC is Libya's interim government.On Friday night, more than 24 hours after Gadhafi's death, the streets of Tripoli still echoed with the sounds of celebratory gunfire, car horns and cheers.In Misrata -- a city scarred by attacks during the Libyan war -- drivers leaned on their horns and came to brake-squealing stops as bands of revelers darted in and out of traffic.The long job of restoring Libya will formally commence this weekend with a declaration from the National Transitional Council, said Ian Martin, the U.N. special representative for Libya.Libyans celebrate Gadhafi's deathObama speaks on Gadhafi's death Moammar Gadhafi: A look backLibyan official: Gadhafi died from gunshot"The formal timetable laid down by the NTC begins with the declaration of liberation," Martin said. "The clock begins ticking and we'll be working with them to try to make their commitments feasible in practice."The commitments are myriad.The NTC must treat thousands of people wounded in months of fighting, rebuild the war-ravaged country, disarm militias, restore basic services and decide how to pursue justice against Gadhafi regime officials accused of wrongdoing during the former Libyan leader's 42 years of rule. And they must do that while trying to create a functioning democracy from whole cloth in a nation with no democratic tradition."It's a very big challenge of course, but I think they're entitled to some time to address that," Martin said, urging governments around the world not to rush to be skeptical of the NTC's commitment to democracy.Moammar Gadhafi's colorful historyFawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics, said Libyans still face a difficult political struggle.The recent fighting around Sirte and Bani Walid -- another holdout of pro-Gadhafi loyalists -- exposed "some major tribal and regional cleavages" that Libyans will have to bridge in forming a new government, he said.Those differences "could easily escalate, given the extent and the intensity of differences in Libya."Shashank Joshi, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said a key division is between Libya's Islamists -- who themselves are fragmented internally to a degree -- and "everyone else," he said.The transitional authorities will also have to work out how to incorporate former regime loyalists and technocrats into the new Libya, he said."The Islamists were oppressed under Gadhafi and have participated in some of the toughest fighting, so they think it's unfair if they do not have a share in power while others -- who may have been party to their oppression in the past -- do," he said.Then there is the matter of consolidating control over the country's security situation."This means ensuring consensus not only at the top of the rebel coalition, but also ensuring that low-level criminals and gangs don't take advantage of the weapons that are still circulating to threaten the safety of Libya's civilian population," said Christopher Chivvis of the RAND Corp., a nonprofit institution that seeks to improve policy and decision-making.The NTC has a plan to reintegrate fighters into civilian life, said Mohammed Sayeh, a senior member of the NTC."They will have to go back to their job," he said. "Libya is liberated. Now Gadhafi is not here anymore. So most of them will go back to their previous profession, whether student or a doctor or other things."Those who don't want to return to civilian life will be absorbed into the military or security services, he said.Meanwhile, NATO is expected to end its role in the Libyan conflict. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Thursday that the alliance "will terminate our mission," launched in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians. NATO's efforts have included strike sorties and airstrikes targeting Gadhafi's military resources.NATO leaders were scheduled to meet Friday to discuss their next steps.Justice for Libya, and Pan Am victimsLibya's new leadership will need to find ways to deal with the thousands of people wounded in the fighting.Some U.S. officials have urged the Obama administration to send a Navy hospital ship to Tripoli or, as U.S. Sen. John McCain suggested Friday, fly some of the wounded to a U.S. Army hospital in Germany.The NTC also has to tend quickly to the populace's basic needs, such as water and power, to bolster its legitimacy, analysts say.Revenue from Libya's oil will go a long way toward that end.The country is already producing an estimated 350,000 barrels of oil per day, up from near zero during the depths of the conflict.Libya could probably double its current production relatively quickly, which at current prices might fetch $80 million or so a day on the open market, analysts say.But a return to its prewar output of 1.6 million barrels a day -- which could net hundreds of millions of dollars a day -- would involve slow, complicated work.The Libyan leadership also is lobbying for the release of what some analysts believe to be as much as $150 billion in frozen assets that had been available to the Gadhafi regime around the world.Those assets range from real estate to stakes in the Italian bank UniCredit; the British publisher Pearson, which owns the Financial Times; and Italy's soccer club Juventus.Even before Gadhafi's death, the U.S. Treasury Department had already started thawing some $37 billion worth such assets to make them available to the new government in Tripoli.The department also partially lifted some Libya sanctions, opening the door for U.S. companies and individuals to do business with the Libyan National Oil Corp. and other companies in Libya.World leaders expressed encouragement for a new Libya but cautioned that the road ahead won't be easy."In the coming days, we will witness scenes of celebration, as well as grief for those who lost so much," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. "Yet let us recognize, immediately, that this is only the end of the beginning.

High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement. "More details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture."Questions also persisted about what would happen to Gadhafi's body. His family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership "to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites," a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported.Libya's interim government, the National Transitional Council, has said Gadhafi's burial will be delayed for a few days to allow International Criminal Court officials to check the body in Misrata if they choose to do so.The whereabouts of Gadhafi's son Saif al-Islam was also in question Friday. The International Criminal Court wants the son for crimes against humanity. Revolutionary fighters said they were on his trail and would capture him soon.Meanwhile, in Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials were scheduled to meet Friday to discuss their next steps after a military campaign that included thousands of airstrikes in Libya -- including one said to have contributed directly to Gadhafi's capture and subsequent death Thursday. Members of the alliance have said its involvement in Libya is nearing its end.New era, challenges loom for Libyans Libyans have been elated over the demise of Gadhafi, who ruled the country for 42 years with an iron fist before he was overthrown in August. Authorities say a Liberation Day will be marked this weekend in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the rebellion first erupted. Officials plan to appoint a new interim prime minister who will establish a cabinet over the next month.Also Friday, the international community reflected on the end of the Gadhafi regime."Our military played a critical role in shaping a situation on the ground in which the Libyan people can build its own future," President Barack Obama said Friday, referring to the U.S. role in the NATO operation in Libya.Photos: Celebrations in LibyaAmid the jubilation, international agencies have raised issues over various and sometimes conflicting accounts of Gadhafi's death, with shaky video images separately showing a wounded but living Gadhafi and, later, his corpse, an apparent bullet wound in his head."As you are aware, there are at least two cell phone videos, one showing him alive and one showing him dead," the U.N. human rights group said Friday. "Taken together, these videos are very disturbing."It called for an investigation into the circumstances of Gadhafi's death."More details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture," the agency said.The statement by Gadhafi's family encouraged such an investigation, saying "the scenes broadcast on media outlets show that the martyrs were betrayed by the forces loyal to NATO," according to the Syrian-based pro-Gadhafi TV station, Al-Rai.Amnesty International, meanwhile, urged Libya's interim leadership, the National Transitional Council, "to make public" all the facts of Gadhafi's death.Amnesty also urged the NTC "to ensure that all those suspected of human rights abuses and war crimes" get humane treatment and are given fair trials if captured. That includes Gadhafi's family members and his inner circle.Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, said Gadhafi was captured alive and unharmed Thursday as fighters overran his hometown of Sirte. But a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle, Jibril said, leaving Gadhafi with a wound to his right arm.More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.Human Rights Watch is calling for an internationally supervised autopsy and an investigation into the death, and one of its officials said it is unlikely that Gadhafi was killed in crossfire.Peter Bouckaert, the group's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a "humiliating end" for the former dictator."When he left the area, he was very much alive," Bouckaert said. "There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice."Video posted on YouTube showed a bloodied Gadhafi moments after capture, surrounded by fighters as he laid on the ground. The deposed leader appeared to remain defiant, even while encircled by men brandishing guns."Shame on you, you're sinning, you're sinning," Gadhafi can be heard saying on the video, according to a CNN translation.What's next for NATO in Libya?NATO said Friday that Gadhafi was in a convoy it struck in the Sirte area Thursday and the action "likely contributed to his capture."A NATO official said Gadhafi loyalists were "boxed in" to one particular area of Sirte, which was scouted by NATO drones and rebel fighters. The airstrike destroyed "multiple vehicles" and NATO members believed Gadhafi was in the convoy but not directly hit."At the time of the strike, NATO did not know that Gadhafi was in the convoy. NATO's intervention was conducted solely to reduce the threat toward the civilian population, as required to do under our U.N. mandate. As a matter of policy, NATO does not target individuals," NATO said in a statement.As for the late despot's burial, Jibril said DNA samples confirmed Gadhafi's identity, and the International Criminal Court -- which had issued an arrest warrant for the ousted dictator on war-crimes charges -- has agreed to allow Gadhafi's burial.NATO forces have been enforcing a U.N. mandate to protect Libyan civilians. Although Libyan fighters eventually captured Gadhafi, Western intervention through NATO was a key factor in his downfall.A NATO official told CNN that NATO ambassadors and Adm. James Stavridis, the supreme allied commander, will discuss ending the alliance's military mission at Friday's meeting in Brussels.Deputy U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Thursday that the operation was "near its end," while French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French radio station Europe 1 early Friday that "the military operation is finished."Following Gadhafi's death, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Thursday that the alliance "will terminate our mission," launched in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians. NATO's efforts have included strike sorties and airstrikes targeting Gadhafi's military resources.Also killed Thursday were Gadhafi's son Motassim and his chief of intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi, said Anees al-Sharif, a spokesman for the NTC's military arm in Tripoli. Other reports say al-Senussi was captured. Jibril said Gadhafi's defense minister, Gen. Abu Baker Younes, also died.Mahmoud Al-Shammam, the NTC's information minister, said forensic reports for both for Moammar and Motassim Gadhafi have been prepared and copies of these reports were sent to government officials in Tripoli.CNN's Joe Sterling, Ivan Watson, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Barbara Starr and Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webNewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse » Loading weather data...

Based on NATO officials, journalists, human rights monitors and witnesses, here is an account of how the strongman's last day transpired.Revolutionary fighters had cornered Gadhafi loyalists in the District 2 area of Sirte. There had been rumors that he was holed up in the city of his birth but speculation also held that he had fled to the desert.Gadhafi's body in Misrata coolerNTC: Gadhafi's death 'unintentional' Gadhafi's burial delayedIn any case, NATO surveillance drones and National Transitional Council commanders had been keeping an eye on District 2 for a while and again on Thursday morning, the drones were out.Somewhere around 8:30 in the morning, according to a NATO official, a convoy of loyalists made a break from that part of Sirte and headed west trying to get out of the city.U.S. drones and French fighter jets struck the convoy, splitting it up and forcing the loyalists to scurry on foot. It's not clear whether Gadhafi was in that convoy but a NATO official said he was, though he was not directly hit."Two miles west of Sirte, 15 pickup trucks mounted with machine guns lay burnt out, smashed and smoldering next to an electricity substation 20 meters from the main road," reported the Reuters news agency.The revolutionaries began shooting at the loyalists."At first we fired at them with anti-aircraft guns, but it was no use," Salem Bakeer told Reuters. "Then we went in on foot."The ferocious firefight lasted three hours, said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, who is in Sirte. He said 95 bodies were found in the area.Gadhafi survived and fled with a handful of his men. The revolutionaries eventually found him hiding in a drainage pipe.Misrata fighter Omran Shaaban told The New York Times that Gadhafi was bleeding from his head and chest but still was able to speak with his trademark indignation. Bakeer told Reuters that Gadhafi was wounded with gunshots in his leg and back. Some accounts described him as confused. Others said he pleaded for his life.Gadhafi was hiding in drainage pipeThe death of a dictatorWhere are Gadhafi's assets?"When he saw us, he said, 'What's happening? Those were the words he spoke," Shaaban told the Times.There were bodies strewn about the 70-feet long chunk of drab, concrete tubing that passed under a road. On it, graffiti scribbled in blue lettering read: "This is the place of the rat, Gadhafi. God is great."It was, of course, Gadhafi who called the rebels rats from the very start of Libya's uprising in February. They had finally caught him. Now it was Gadhafi, the self-styled "king of kings" of Africa who was caught like a rat amid rubbish and rocks and sandHe was captured alive. But that's when the stories diverge.The National Transitional Council's leadership says Gadhafi was killed in crossfire between revolutionary fighters and the remnants of loyalists in Sirte.Mohammed Sayeh, a senior member of the council, told CNN that Gadhafi was being transported to Misrata to the northwest."They were taking him to a hospital," he said.In the hail of gunfire, Sayeh said, Gadhafi was shot in the feet and then in his head."I cannot tell you whether it was from far or near, but it was unintentional," he said. "No one decided to kill him or slaughter him. It would have been much better for us Libyans and the whole universe to capture him and take him to a court."But cell phone videos and other accounts seem to contradict Sayeh's statement. And questions remain about when and exactly how Gadhafi died.One man told the BBC that he saw Gadhafi being shot with a 9mm gun in the abdomen at around 12:30 p.m. That was four hours before the National Transitional Council's executive board Chairman Mahmoud Jibril announced that Gadhafi was dead.Ibrahim Tika, a doctor who allegedly performed DNA tests on Gadhafi's body Friday, told Al Arabiya television that Gadhafi was shot in the head and stomach.Bouckaert said he did not believe Gadhafi was killed in crossfire. From what Human Rights Watch has learned, Bouckaert said Gadhafi did not have a gunshot wound in his head when he was captured."He was taken into the streets," he said. "Enraged crowds started beating him, pulling his hair. They tried to put him on a hood of a car and drive him away. He fell off."In a shaky amateur video, a bloodied Gadhafi is seen alive and being hoisted onto a truck. Another, obtained by the Al-Jazeera network, showed his corpse on the ground, a bullet wound in his head. A third piece of footage posted on YouTube showed fighters grabbing Gadhafi's tangled curls and jerking his head about."It certainly was a very humiliating end for Gadhafi," Bouckaert said. "But when he left this area he was very much alive."The The different versions of how Gadhafi met his end prompted the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to ask for investigations. Bouckaert said an autopsy on his body ought to be internationally supervised.For weeks, the revolutionaries had been on the forefront of the battle for Sirte, struggling to wrest control of the coastal city from the last vestiges of the old regime in brutal urban warfare. Thursday, when the fight was finally won, they could finally claim liberation for their nation.They waved Gadhafi's golden gun in the air.The revolutionaries also took Gadhafi's satellite phone, his brown scarf and one black boot, the Times reported, to keep as ultimate trophies of their victory.But their first day of freedom, said Bouckaert, is now blemished with the suspicious circumstances of the former tyrant's death.Friday, Gadhafi's bloody, battered body lay on a mattress in a Misrata market cold storage room, Reuters reported. The news agency showed video of curious onlookers snapping pictures with their mobile phones.It was unclear when and how he would be put to rest, even though Muslim rites require burial within 24 hours.Mahmoud al-Shammam, the National Transitional Council's information minister, told CNN that a funeral would be postponed for a few days just in case officials from the International Criminal Court -- which had an arrest warrant out for Gadhafi for alleged crimes against humanity -- wanted to see the body firsthand.In his 42 years in power, Gadhafi embraced eccentric tactics and cold-blooded violence, meting out cruel forms of punishment to those he perceived as his enemies. He should have faced justice in court, many Libyans as well as human rights activists said.Instead, he was like many of his victims whose ignominious end raised plenty of questions.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webPart of complete coverage on Death of a dictator Moammar Gadhafi: A look backupdated 4:23 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's John Vause looks back at the rise and fall of mercurial Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed on Thursday.Libyans in London react with joyupdated 6:50 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Libyan students studying in London gather in front of the Libyan embassy and celebrate Gadhafi's death.Opinion: Justice for Pan Am victimsupdated 7:13 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Brian Flynn, the brother of a victim of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland, says Moammar Gadhafi's death is justice long delayed.Social media response to the newsupdated 4:28 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's Errol Barnett reports on the global social media reaction to Moammar Gadhafi's death.The end of the Gadhafi eraupdated 3:40 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011After months of fighting between rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces, deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been killed.Opinion: Hard work ahead for Libyaupdated 4:45 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011The death of Moammar Gadhafi is not the game-changer many would like it to be, writes Brookings' Shadi HamidWhy Gadhafi wouldn't surrenderFareed Zakaria on Gadhafi's fate: "He had always been a fighter -- romantic, mad, crazy -- so I always suspected he would go down fighting"Gadhafi's last moments aliveupdated 1:02 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is seen in what may be his final moments as he is captured by rebel forces.How Gadhafi sought world stageupdated 4:06 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Over four decades in power in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi portrayed himself as the leader of a united Africa and the "king of kings" of his oil-rich desert nation.Photos: Gadhafi through the yearsFrom first taking power in 1969 to appearances in Tripoli this summer, take a look at Gadhafi over the past few decadesGadhafi's legacy in Africaupdated 8:10 AM EST, Wed October 5, 2011The African stage once belonged to Moammar Gadhafi, nicknamed the "king of kings of Africa" by fellow leaders.A long 8 months in Libyaupdated 3:07 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Fighting in Libya started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a civil war.World reacts to Gadhafiupdated 10:24 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Reactions to the reported death of deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has started to trickle in from around the world.Warning to dictators: You're nextupdated 5:45 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Dictators around the Middle East should pay close attention to the fate of Moammar Gadhafi, opposition activists from Syria and Yemen say.NewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse » Loading weather data...

Isobel Coleman says it is unclear who will lead the country.STORY HIGHLIGHTS Isobel Coleman: Libya best positioned economically of Arab Spring nations She says the population is well educated, with literacy rate near 90$ Libya has billions in the bank and more money in frozen foreign assets Coleman: New leadership is unclear and transition may be rockyEditor's note: Isobel Coleman is the author of "Paradise Beneath Her Feet" and a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. New York (CNN) -- Libyans poured into the streets Thursday to celebrate the death of Moammar Gadhafi. After months of intense fighting, rebel fighters finally overran Gadhafi's last stronghold in his hometown of Sirte, marking the end of his 42-year rule.Although Gadhafi's rule effectively ended two months ago when he fled Tripoli, his death provides closure and a sense of relief to many in the country who had opposed his tyrannical rule. It also greatly reduces the likelihood of a prolonged insurgency by Gadhafi loyalists and allows the transitional government to move forward with the hard work of building a new political system.The challenges ahead are great: Since the Gadhafi regime so effectively monopolized the public sphere, Libya has no real civil society or effective political institutions.After decades of tyranny, there is a deep distrust of government. There is also fear of revenge killings by those who suffered under Gadhafi's brutality. Tensions are already evident between Islamists and secularists, and between technocrats returning from abroad and those who stayed and opposed the regime at enormous personal expense. Well-armed militias have yet to be formally disbanded or integrated into a national army; large caches of arms, including some sophisticated missiles, are not accounted for and could end up in the hands of extremists.Isobel ColemanNevertheless, of all the Arab states that have been convulsed by revolts this year, Libya has by far the strongest economic prospects. Its relatively small population of 6.5 million and vast oil wealth give it the best chance of meeting the economic aspirations of its citizens.Just recently, the transitional government announced that it had discovered an additional $23 billion in the Central Bank of Libya, enough to cover the costs of government for at least six months. It has an additional $160 billion in foreign assets, which are frozen overseas but will eventually be released.Libya also has a relatively well-educated population. Public education was free and compulsory through secondary school under Gadhafi, and the country enjoys a literacy rate of nearly 90%. In the 2007-2008 school year, women enrolled in universities outnumbered men significantly.According to the Transitional National Council constitution, legislative and presidential elections to form a new government must be held within a year of liberation. The constitution also stipulates that no member of the council can participate in this newly elected government, a provision meant to limit the influence of the interim body. So far, transitional leaders seem willing to abide by that provision, but jockeying for power has only just begun.Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jabril, American educated and unabashedly secular, announced recently that he would step down at the close of the fighting, but it is not clear if he will follow through on his promise, or if he does, who will succeed him. Jabril and Ali Tarhouni, the acting Finance and Oil Minister who was teaching economics in the United States before joining the rebellion, have been criticized for being outsiders, too secular and too connected to remnants of the former regime.Some are pointing to Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the NTC commander of the militia in Tripoli, as a major player in the future political field. Belhaj was arrested in 2004 by the Central Intelligence Agency and rendered to Libya, where he was held and tortured in the infamous Abu Salim prison. The warrant for his arrest accused him of ties to al Qaeda, which he has denied. Belhaj has also disavowed extremism and pledged tolerance.Islamists will undoubtedly play an influential role in Libya's new government, and outward signs of Islamic piety, suppressed under Gadhafi, are now on the rise across the country. But leaders across the political spectrum continue to insist on moderation and tolerance. Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of the transitional council, has called for a Libyan state founded on Sharia that is also inclusive of women and minorities. U.S. and European support for the rebels over the past seven months generated positive feelings among Libyans for NATO countries, which points to a possible Western-aligned Libyan government that is nonetheless markedly Islamic in character.Gadhafi's death marks an important moment of transition for Libyans. Reconciliation and integration will be imperative at this point, especially as the dust of war clears and evidence emerges of brutality committed by both rebel forces and Gadhafi loyalists. As demonstrated painfully in Iraq, lasting stability requires opportunities for Gadhafi supporters to participate in the new order, but with war wounds still fresh, this will require remarkable leadership and forbearance on the part of transitional leaders.A stable, prosperous Libya undergoing a process of democratization will enhance the chance of successful transitions in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. This helps explain the sense of jubilation across the region that erupted on the news of Gadhafi's death. The era of tyrants seems to be coming to an end. Protesters in Syria and Yemen held out signs asking their leaders if they want to go the same violent way.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Isobel Coleman.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webPart of complete coverage on Death of a dictator Moammar Gadhafi: A look backupdated 4:23 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's John Vause looks back at the rise and fall of mercurial Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed on Thursday.Libyans in London react with joyupdated 6:50 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Libyan students studying in London gather in front of the Libyan embassy and celebrate Gadhafi's death.Opinion: Justice for Pan Am victimsupdated 7:13 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Brian Flynn, the brother of a victim of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland, says Moammar Gadhafi's death is justice long delayed.Social media response to the newsupdated 4:28 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's Errol Barnett reports on the global social media reaction to Moammar Gadhafi's death.The end of the Gadhafi eraupdated 3:40 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011After months of fighting between rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces, deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been killed.Opinion: Hard work ahead for Libyaupdated 4:45 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011The death of Moammar Gadhafi is not the game-changer many would like it to be, writes Brookings' Shadi HamidWhy Gadhafi wouldn't surrenderFareed Zakaria on Gadhafi's fate: "He had always been a fighter -- romantic, mad, crazy -- so I always suspected he would go down fighting"Gadhafi's last moments aliveupdated 1:02 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is seen in what may be his final moments as he is captured by rebel forces.How Gadhafi sought world stageupdated 4:06 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Over four decades in power in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi portrayed himself as the leader of a united Africa and the "king of kings" of his oil-rich desert nation.Photos: Gadhafi through the yearsFrom first taking power in 1969 to appearances in Tripoli this summer, take a look at Gadhafi over the past few decadesGadhafi's legacy in Africaupdated 8:10 AM EST, Wed October 5, 2011The African stage once belonged to Moammar Gadhafi, nicknamed the "king of kings of Africa" by fellow leaders.A long 8 months in Libyaupdated 3:07 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Fighting in Libya started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a civil war.World reacts to Gadhafiupdated 10:24 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Reactions to the reported death of deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has started to trickle in from around the world.Warning to dictators: You're nextupdated 5:45 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Dictators around the Middle East should pay close attention to the fate of Moammar Gadhafi, opposition activists from Syria and Yemen say.NewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse » Loading weather data...

He was later reported killed.STORY HIGHLIGHTS Brian Flynn: It has been 23 years since bombing of Pan Am 103 Flynn' s brother was killed in the bombing, and family has waited for justice He says he would rather have seen Gadhafi face war crimes trial for harm he caused Flynn: It isn't about revenge, but justice for Pan Am victims and for Libya's peopleEditor's note: Brian Flynn is the brother of Lockerbie victim J.P. Flynn and vice president of Pan Am 103, an advocacy organization. He is a business adviser. New York (CNN) -- Many times I've watched in dismay as crowds of Moammar Gadhafi supporters gathered to wave flags in front of Libya's former dictator -- in particular, two years ago, when the convicted murderer Abdul Al Megrahi returned to his home country under the guise of near-death, to be welcomed as a hero, banners waving, Gadhafi embracing the man who helped him kill my brother.We watched in jaw-dropped horror as these two conspirators embraced in front of what we believed to be a throng of paid political cheerleaders.We'd often heard that part of the way Gadhafi kept up the sparkly image of a happy, well-led people was to pay them to show up and look as though they were viewing a god. It's classic imperial propaganda: Make sure the little people show the love when the cameras are on. It's a method designed by Joseph Goebbels and painstakingly perfected by Gadhafi.Brian FlynnToday, as I look at the images streaming from halfway around the world, my heart is deeply moved by what I see on the faces of a liberated people. In a country where the economic disparity has historically been far greater than any place since Ancient Rome, a true revolution has occurred. The impoverished, the downtrodden, the unlawfully imprisoned, the enslaved, are all pouring into the streets with their new, green flag of freedom, tears of relief and even disbelief etched on their faces.This is their day. My 23-year struggle for justice is a grain of sand compared to what the Libyan people have endured.Gadhafi's death an answer to little girl's prayerGadhafi and the truth of LockerbiePan Am 103 relative on Gadhafi deathGadhafi's burial delayedI have had countless e-mails and phone calls today, asking me if I'm happy, and if I feel that my brother can finally rest in peace. At the risk of sounding like I'm never satisfied, I have to say that I am not entirely happy. Sure, some weird, throttled joy is bubbling up in me today, and I don't hold with any camp that would contend that "Gadhafi deserved a fair trial." But yet I fear that with his death goes a warehouse of secrets and lies that could have been revealed in order to salve the souls of Libyan families who lost loved ones during this regime. Men and women have literally disappeared from their houses and places of work and worship, only to be buried in mass graves.I know where my brother rests in peace, innocent of any crime other than being an American on the wrong plane at the very wrong time in history. Rather than wanting to see the kind of freak-show snuff film of Gadhafi that is worming its way through the internet as I write this, I would have far preferred to watch him from a front row seat in the Hague as he, in true Milosevic style, would have been made to answer for his countless hideous crimes.In the 23 years since I lost my brother I have fought (alongside my parents) for this day. Many times I have been accused of wanting revenge, of not tempering my desire to see Gadhafi and all his cohorts brought to heel. Today, as that dish is served to me ice-cold, I can tell you honestly it has never been about revenge.Today, as ever, it has been about justice, for those 270 innocent American and Scottish citizens who fell to earth like so many doused stars on a cold night in late December. Today, as ever, it has also been about justice for the 6.5 million Libyans, who no longer need to be paid to look happy when the world's cameras point their way.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Flynn.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webPart of complete coverage on Death of a dictator Moammar Gadhafi: A look backupdated 4:23 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's John Vause looks back at the rise and fall of mercurial Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed on Thursday.Libyans in London react with joyupdated 6:50 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Libyan students studying in London gather in front of the Libyan embassy and celebrate Gadhafi's death.Opinion: Justice for Pan Am victimsupdated 7:13 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Brian Flynn, the brother of a victim of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland, says Moammar Gadhafi's death is justice long delayed.Social media response to the newsupdated 4:28 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's Errol Barnett reports on the global social media reaction to Moammar Gadhafi's death.The end of the Gadhafi eraupdated 3:40 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011After months of fighting between rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces, deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been killed.Opinion: Hard work ahead for Libyaupdated 4:45 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011The death of Moammar Gadhafi is not the game-changer many would like it to be, writes Brookings' Shadi HamidWhy Gadhafi wouldn't surrenderFareed Zakaria on Gadhafi's fate: "He had always been a fighter -- romantic, mad, crazy -- so I always suspected he would go down fighting"Gadhafi's last moments aliveupdated 1:02 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is seen in what may be his final moments as he is captured by rebel forces.How Gadhafi sought world stageupdated 4:06 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Over four decades in power in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi portrayed himself as the leader of a united Africa and the "king of kings" of his oil-rich desert nation.Photos: Gadhafi through the yearsFrom first taking power in 1969 to appearances in Tripoli this summer, take a look at Gadhafi over the past few decadesGadhafi's legacy in Africaupdated 8:10 AM EST, Wed October 5, 2011The African stage once belonged to Moammar Gadhafi, nicknamed the "king of kings of Africa" by fellow leaders.A long 8 months in Libyaupdated 3:07 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Fighting in Libya started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a civil war.World reacts to Gadhafiupdated 10:24 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Reactions to the reported death of deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has started to trickle in from around the world.Warning to dictators: You're nextupdated 5:45 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Dictators around the Middle East should pay close attention to the fate of Moammar Gadhafi, opposition activists from Syria and Yemen say.NewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse » Loading weather data...

Lohan posted $100,000 bail for her probation revocation, but Sautner ordered her to perform two working shifts -- or eight hours a day -- twice a week at the morgue until her probation revocation hearing November 2."Her duties will include general janitorial work like vaccuuming, taking trash out and cleaning bathrooms," Winter said.Lohan, 25, was on probation after pleading guilty in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. She served five weeks of home confinement ending in June for that misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation.Lohan's legal woes began in 2007 with two drunken driving arrests, and they've been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and her failures of alcohol and drug tests.CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webNewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse »   Healthcare Jobs Sales and Marketing Jobs Finance Jobs Quick Job Search   Job type ----------------- Accounting Admin & Clerical Automotive Banking Biotech Broadcast - Journalism Business Development Construction Consultant Customer Service Design Distribution - Shipping Education Engineering Entry Level - New Grad Executive Facilities Finance General Business General Labor Government Grocery Healthcare Hotel - Hospitality Human Resources Information Technology Installation - Maint - Repair Insurance Inventory Legal Legal Admin Management Manufacturing Marketing Nurse Other Pharmacy Professional Services Purchasing - Procurement QA - Quality Control Research Restaurant - Food Service Retail Sales Science Skilled Labor - Trades Strategy - Planning Supply Chain Telecomm Training Transportation Warehouse State ------- AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA PR RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY   more options »         Loading weather data...

Scholar and author Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, says that 2011 "is to the Arabs what 1989 was to the communist world. The Arabs are now coming into ownership of their own history and we have to celebrate."Protesters in Yemen and Syria may be re-energized by the pictures from Sirte, Libya, showing the almost pathetic end of a ruler whose flowing robes and uniforms had long given him an aura of invincibility. Demonstrators in Syrian cities celebrated Gadhafi's death and warned President Bashar al-Assad that he would be next. As one Syrian activist told CNN: "The clear fate of all who kill his people is to end up under the feet of the nation."Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri (no friend of the Syria regime) said: "Any Arab citizen, watching the course of events in Libya, cannot but think of the popular revolutionary movement that is taking place in Syria."There has been one refrain common across the Arab world this year -- from the dusty streets of Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia, where it all began, to the barricades that litter Homs in Syria today: "The fear is gone, the people have put away their fear." Those words, spoken by Tunisian activist Sana Ben Achour in January, have echoed across the region ever since. It was quickly followed by a chant: "The people want the downfall of the regime."Gadhafi's body in Misrata coolerColumnist: Gadhafi death a huge milestone'End of an era' after Gadhafi's deathArab world reacts to Gadhafi's deathEven so, it took U.N. resolutions and thousands of NATO sorties to degrade Gadhafi's forces. And that's unlikely elsewhere. The United States and Western Europe are applying economic sanctions against the Syrian regime but have persistently discounted military intervention. President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen seems impervious to outside pressure and even his own injuries as he maneuvers back into the game. And in a majority of Arab countries, the power of the state remains formidable if not overwhelming.In 1989, the people of Eastern Europe shared a continent with developed democracies; they had a model to copy -- and considerable help in shaking off the legacy of communism.The Arab states, which did not even draw their own borders, each have different dynamics. Explosive sectarian and regional divides have enabled authoritarian rule in Syria, Yemen and Libya. Like the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco are monarchies and their kings at least have the legitimacy of succession. Egypt and Tunisia have by Arab standards a large and capable middle class; Yemen does not. The Gulf states are enriched by massive oil and gas reserves; countries such as Jordan have little or none. The attitude toward women's rights varies widely; Islamists are stronger in some countries than others.Perhaps most importantly, security forces are in some places loyal to the flag, in others bound to the regime, or split down the middle. The military in Tunisia and Egypt would not defend leaders who became liabilities; the military in Syria has remained cohesive and loyal to al-Assad.But one of the few characteristics Arab states have long shared is the "freedom deficit," the product of decades of authoritarian rule. A landmark report on Arab societies by the U.N. Development Program in 2002 concluded: "This freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development."The situation changed little in the following decade, but other forces were at work. The pan-Arab satellite television networks -- so different from the sclerotic state broadcasters -- gave Arabs a new window on the world. The educated young began to harness the power of the Internet, outflanking the ability of bureaucracies to control it.They saw their contemporaries in the rest of the world -- Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe -- gaining new skills and opportunities, while they remained out of work. At the same time, unemployment in the Arab world, especially among graduates, remained high; corruption and nepotism were rampant. Time and again U.S. diplomatic cables sent from Arab capitals noted a growing tide of popular resentment toward their rulers.The 2009 edition of the U.N. Development Program report wrote: "The result is an all-too-common sense of limited opportunities and personal insecurity, witnessed in the world's highest levels of unemployment, deep and contentious patterns of exclusion, and, ultimately, strong calls from within for reform."Ultimately, those calls spilled onto the streets in spontaneous and chaotic fashion. Now, in three countries that between them occupy 2,000 miles of Mediterranean coastline, the hard work has begun of shaping what's next. Revolutions are invariably messy affairs whose outcomes are never guaranteed, whatever the ideals of their leaders. The French historian Alexis de Tocqueville wrote: "In a revolution, as in a novel, the most difficult part to invent is the end."Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics, said that in Libya's case "the cleavages that we have seen in Sirte and Bani Walid that have resisted the new government are extremely alarming. We shall see whether out of this particular turmoil will emerge a unified government with a unified leadership or the political struggle will escalate and intensify."This weekend Tunisians will become the first Arabs to elect a constituent assembly, which in turn will draw up a new constitution. But there is no path to follow. What should be the powers of president, prime minister and parliament? How is power shared between the center and regions? How are minority rights protected and the independence of the judiciary guaranteed? What is the role of Islam in society?That last question has already made its way to the top of the agenda in Tunisia, with the Islamist Ennahada party leading polls. Its leader, Rachid Ganouchi, accuses opponents of scare tactics to frighten businesses and women. But the leader of one secular party says the Islamists pose a threat to the country.As Arabs scour the horizon for templates, some look to Turkey, where a moderate Islamist party has been elected three times in a decade and presided over an economic renaissance. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan even embarked on a tour of Arab states last month (and in most places was greeted rapturously) to promote the Turkish model."A secular state does not mean that the people are atheists," Erdogan told a television show in Cairo. "It means respect for all religions and each individual has the freedom to practice his own religion."But even in Ankara, tensions persist between the government and a military command that sees itself as the guardian of a secular state, and the government is accused of stifling and harassing its critics.The overthrow of three men does not change the basic dilemmas faced by the Arab world: illiteracy, unemployment, a youth bulge (the United Nations estimates that Arab countries will need 50 million new jobs by 2020), chronic water shortages, a lack of women's rights, the legacy of the "freedom deficit" -- to which perhaps add now a burgeoning crisis of expectations.If the Arab Spring were on a calendar, we would still be in the first week.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webPart of complete coverage on Death of a dictator Moammar Gadhafi: A look backupdated 4:23 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's John Vause looks back at the rise and fall of mercurial Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed on Thursday.Libyans in London react with joyupdated 6:50 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Libyan students studying in London gather in front of the Libyan embassy and celebrate Gadhafi's death.Opinion: Justice for Pan Am victimsupdated 7:13 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Brian Flynn, the brother of a victim of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland, says Moammar Gadhafi's death is justice long delayed.Social media response to the newsupdated 4:28 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011CNN's Errol Barnett reports on the global social media reaction to Moammar Gadhafi's death.The end of the Gadhafi eraupdated 3:40 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011After months of fighting between rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces, deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been killed.Opinion: Hard work ahead for Libyaupdated 4:45 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011The death of Moammar Gadhafi is not the game-changer many would like it to be, writes Brookings' Shadi HamidWhy Gadhafi wouldn't surrenderFareed Zakaria on Gadhafi's fate: "He had always been a fighter -- romantic, mad, crazy -- so I always suspected he would go down fighting"Gadhafi's last moments aliveupdated 1:02 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is seen in what may be his final moments as he is captured by rebel forces.How Gadhafi sought world stageupdated 4:06 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Over four decades in power in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi portrayed himself as the leader of a united Africa and the "king of kings" of his oil-rich desert nation.Photos: Gadhafi through the yearsFrom first taking power in 1969 to appearances in Tripoli this summer, take a look at Gadhafi over the past few decadesGadhafi's legacy in Africaupdated 8:10 AM EST, Wed October 5, 2011The African stage once belonged to Moammar Gadhafi, nicknamed the "king of kings of Africa" by fellow leaders.A long 8 months in Libyaupdated 3:07 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Fighting in Libya started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a civil war.World reacts to Gadhafiupdated 10:24 PM EST, Thu October 20, 2011Reactions to the reported death of deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has started to trickle in from around the world.Warning to dictators: You're nextupdated 5:45 AM EST, Fri October 21, 2011Dictators around the Middle East should pay close attention to the fate of Moammar Gadhafi, opposition activists from Syria and Yemen say.NewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse »   Healthcare Jobs Sales and Marketing Jobs Finance Jobs Quick Job Search   Job type ----------------- Accounting Admin & Clerical Automotive Banking Biotech Broadcast - Journalism Business Development Construction Consultant Customer Service Design Distribution - Shipping Education Engineering Entry Level - New Grad Executive Facilities Finance General Business General Labor Government Grocery Healthcare Hotel - Hospitality Human Resources Information Technology Installation - Maint - Repair Insurance Inventory Legal Legal Admin Management Manufacturing Marketing Nurse Other Pharmacy Professional Services Purchasing - Procurement QA - Quality Control Research Restaurant - Food Service Retail Sales Science Skilled Labor - Trades Strategy - Planning Supply Chain Telecomm Training Transportation Warehouse State ------- AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA PR RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY   more options »         Loading weather data...

He can be reached at spoliti@starledger.com, or follow him on Twitter: @StevePoliti(CNN) -- Turns out, Vince Lombardi was wrong. Winning isn't the only thing. In some NFL cities this season, losing matters even more.From Miami to Indianapolis, from Minnesota to St. Louis, some fans want their team to lose as many games as possible to get the No. 1 pick in the next NFL draft, which would give them an opportunity to draft the player who is widely regarded as the most polished prospect at quarterback in years to enter the league.Or, to use the rallying cry that's becoming popular, they want their team to "Suck for Luck."His name is Andrew Luck, and he's a redshirt junior at Stanford. He would have been the No. 1 pick had he declared for the draft after his junior season, when he completed 70.7% of his passes for 3,338 yards, 32 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. He is on pace to match or even top those numbers this season for the Cardinal, which is 6-0 and hosts Washington on Saturday.But his value is more than just numbers. He has all the tools that make a great quarterback, a 6-foot-4 frame with a cannon for an arm, plus a feel for the game beyond his 22 years. One player cannot transform a football team. But every team covets a franchise player at the most important position on the field, and Luck, who has another year of eligibility that no one expects him to use, is probably the best to come out of college since Peyton Manning in 1998.Even the great Manning, however, wasn't a lock for the No. 1 pick like Luck is in 2012. Hard as it is to believe, some analysts thought Ryan Leaf, an eventual bust in the NFL, was a better choice. Nobody is a close second this year. Luck, barring a catastrophe, will go to the team with the worst record in the league."He is the real deal," John Madden, the longtime NFL analyst and Hall of Fame coach, said on Sirius satellite radio this week. "I've been watching the NFL for years, and I don't remember a more automatic, sure thing."Which leads to the "Suck for Luck" movement. The precise origins of that phrase are unknown. It has become a Twitter handle -- @SuckForLuck -- which is "imploring the Miami Dolphins or the terrible NFL team of your choice to tank for the #1 overall pick."The Dolphins are the clear favorites in the Suck for Luck sweepstakes, but hardly the only contender. Here are the teams with the best shot at sucking enough to get the No. 1 pick, with their odds:Miami: Not only do the Dolphins (0-5) have a lame duck coach, Tony Sparano, and an overmatched quarterback, Matt Moore, they also have an owner who seems resigned to the quest. According to the Miami Herald, owner Stephen Ross has told his friends he's willing to put up with short-term losses if the end result is the franchise quarterback his team needs. Odds: 2-1.Indianapolis: Colts Vice Chairman Bill Polian recently scouted Luck, and with good reason. The Colts (0-6) are owners of the worst record in football and seem completely hapless without Manning. But Manning is expected to return from neck surgery and just agreed to a $90 million contract with the team. Could the Colts really draft Luck and start him as a backup? You bet. Odds: 4-1.Minnesota: The Vikings (1-5) rolled the dice in the offseason, acquiring veteran quarterback Donovan McNabb, but he has struggled mightily and will be replaced this week by untested Christian Ponder. Viking fans have been waiting years for a great quarterback in his prime, and have to be salivating at the prospects of having Luck and All-Pro running back Adrian Peterson in the same huddle. Still, with Peterson, Minnesota is going to win games this year. Odds: 8-1.St. Louis: The Rams (0-5) certainly have the suck part covered, but they believe, in young quarterback Sam Bradford, that they already have their franchise quarterback. Would they bail on him to grab Luck? Hey, they could always trade him. But playing in the woeful NFC West will lead to a few victories for Bradford and Co. Odds: 10-1.The field: Carolina (1-5) is off to a slow start but just used the No. 1 pick in the 2011 draft on former Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, who has dazzled at times in his rookie season. Arizona (1-4) has lost four straight games, but made the trade for quarterback Kevin Kolb. Denver (1-4) made the switch to Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, a folk hero for his conservative views, so it seems unlikely the Broncos would suck enough. Odds: 15-1.One other wrinkle: Luck's father, Oliver, is a former NFL quarterback himself. Would the Luck family try to pull a draft-day power play like some other franchise quarterbacks, including Eli Manning and John Elway, and refuse to sign with a team it deems unacceptable?Until April, it's all speculation ... and, for the contenders, losing."We don't really pay much attention to it, to be honest with you," Denver coach John Fox said this week when asked about the Luck sweepstakes. "But it's part of the popularity of our great game of NFL football. Being a competitor, I don't know many coaches or players to be different. You're trying to win every game."Luck, not surprisingly, thinks this entire "Suck for Luck" thing is ridiculous. He returned to Stanford this season because he loves the college experience, not to create a year of fans hoping for their teams to lose. His former college coach Jim Harbaugh, now the 49ers coach, has called Luck "as good a competitor as you'll ever see." He is 26-5 as a starter."I am aware of it," Luck told the New York Times. "A couple of guys told me about it. I think it's stupid. Simply put."It may be stupid, but it'll be one of the most-watched storylines of the 2011 season. While the teams at the top chase a Super Bowl title, ultimately the biggest winner could end up being this year's biggest loser.Share this on: Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn We recommendFrom around the webNewsPulseMost popular stories right nowSix-figure salaries, but homelessObama: Iraq war will be over by year's endLindsay Lohan reports for morgue duty'Suck for Luck': Best hope for NFL's worst?Gadhafi: Enigma in life and deathExplore the news with NewsPulse »   Healthcare Jobs Sales and Marketing Jobs Finance Jobs Quick Job Search   Job type ----------------- Accounting Admin & Clerical Automotive Banking Biotech Broadcast - Journalism Business Development Construction Consultant Customer Service Design Distribution - Shipping Education Engineering Entry Level - New Grad Executive Facilities Finance General Business General Labor Government Grocery Healthcare Hotel - Hospitality Human Resources Information Technology Installation - Maint - Repair Insurance Inventory Legal Legal Admin Management Manufacturing Marketing Nurse Other Pharmacy Professional Services Purchasing - Procurement QA - Quality Control Research Restaurant - Food Service Retail Sales Science Skilled Labor - Trades Strategy - Planning Supply Chain Telecomm Training Transportation Warehouse State ------- AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA PR RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY   more options »         Loading weather data...

Political Breaking News alerts Personalized e-mail alerts tips and hints Tips and hints on refining your alert Your E-mail Alerts only returns stories that contain all the words you used in setting up the alert. Refining or narrowing your alert is as simple as adding more words to the keywords you have already entered. The more words you type in, the more specific the results will be Put double-quotes around phrases that you want to find. For example, if you want to be alerted on the specific phrase George W. Bush, type in "George W. Bush". Always double-check your spelling if you do not receive any alerts. If no alerts are received, review the terms that you entered to make sure that you did not misspell any terms. If you did, visit "Manage Alerts" and correct the spelling for your alert. Only documents containing all of the words in the query will be returned. If you are looking for a specific item, type several words that will definitely be included in that document. For example, if you're looking for something less specific, just type in "tax" and you'll get more matches. There is no need to include "and" between terms. If you select a generic word, you will receive every article from CNN.com and CNNmoney.com that includes the generic keyword. Filter out keywords by using the "excluding" field Refine your alert by entering keywords that you want filtered out. For example, if you are interested in stories about George Bush but not stories that include the word "taxes", enter "George Bush" in the keyword field and "taxes" in the "excluding" field. Capitalization Alert topics are NOT case sensitive. All letters, regardless of how you type them, will be understood as lower case. For example, alerts for "george bush", "George Bush", and "gEoRgE bUsH" will all return the same results. Select words or phrases that are descriptive Think about how you would describe the perfect story or resource for your alert. If you want information about stem cell research in Europe, type in exactly that - "Stem Cell Research Europe" (remember to use double-quotes). Tell us what matters to you. We'll e-mail you promptly when we release stories on these topics.

If no alerts are received, review the terms that you entered to make sure that you did not misspell any terms. If you did, visit "Manage Alerts" and correct the spelling for your alert. Only documents containing all of the words in the query will be returned. If you are looking for a specific item, type several words that will definitely be included in that document. For example, if you're looking for something less specific, just type in "tax" and you'll get more matches. There is no need to include "and" between terms. If you select a generic word, you will receive every article from CNN.com and CNNmoney.com that includes the generic keyword. Filter out keywords by using the "excluding" field Refine your alert by entering keywords that you want filtered out. For example, if you are interested in stories about George Bush but not stories that include the word "taxes", enter "George Bush" in the keyword field and "taxes" in the "excluding" field. Capitalization Alert topics are NOT case sensitive. All letters, regardless of how you type them, will be understood as lower case. For example, alerts for "george bush", "George Bush", and "gEoRgE bUsH" will all return the same results. Select words or phrases that are descriptive Think about how you would describe the perfect story or resource for your alert. If you want information about stem cell research in Europe, type in exactly that - "Stem Cell Research Europe" (remember to use double-quotes). Tell us what matters to you. We'll e-mail you promptly when we release stories on these topics.

We also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. Information Sharing and Disclosure We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another entity. Our agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement and are not authorized to use the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.

We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If a Turner Network site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses either at the point of submission of your personally identifiable information or prior to any such disclosure.

Cookies & Web Beacons To enhance your online experience, we use "cookies" or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our sites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising. We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or sites. This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising. For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" below. The Adobe Flash Player is a powerful application and web tool that allows rapid development of highly dynamic content. Sites on the Turner Network employ locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") in certain situations where we use Flash to provide special content such as video on demand, video clips or animation. Flash (and similar applications) use this technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser. You can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's website directly. We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at Turner Network sites. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors Some of our sites contain links to or integrations with other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Turner Network sites covered by this privacy statement may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information. We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement. Ad Choices Our goal at the Turner Network is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. Advertising enables us to provide the rich content for which sites on the Turner Network are known. Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across the Turner Network's diverse websites. For example, if you often visit content on the Turner Network about travel, we may use "web beacons" to infer your possible interest in travel and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest. It's important to understand that these technologies do not use personally identifiable information to make this happen but instead use anonymous identifiers within the "cookies" stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our Ad Choices page. Turner's Participation in the Industry Self Regulatory Program for Interest Based Ads; Additional Choice Options Turner is a participant in the online industry's self regulatory program administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (the "DAA") and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's principles applicable to interest-based ads. Please visit the Self Regulatory Program site for more information about the DAA, the self regulatory principles and choices you can make regarding interest-based ads. You may find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make through the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") at the NAI site. International Transfer Turner operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will likely be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. The data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using this site you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this privacy statement. Our Commitment to Security We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. How You Can Access or Correct Information Access to personally identifiable information that is collected from our sites and that we maintain may be available to you.

You may also send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street address requesting access to or correction of your personally identifiable information. For verification purposes please include your first name, last name, e-mail address and the password you use for such service. E-mail Administration Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

An example: If you often visit content on the Turner Network about travel, we may use "web beacons" to infer your possible interest in travel and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest. It's important to understand that these technologies do not use personally identifiable information to make this happen but instead use anonymous identifiers within the "cookies" stored in your browser. What happens if I opt-out? If you opt out of interest-based ads on this site or another Turner Network site, please be aware of the following: You will no longer receive interest-based ads on the Turner Network sites. You will still see the same number of ads as before, but they may not be as relevant to you. The Turner Network's opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied. If you use other computers or browsers and want to opt out of interest-based ads on any of those, you will need to repeat this process for each computer or browser. If you delete your browser cookies and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based ads, you will need to return to this page and opt out again. You can change your preferences at any time to enable interest-based ads by returning to this page and selecting "opt in." I'd like to opt out of interest-based ads. How do I do that?
